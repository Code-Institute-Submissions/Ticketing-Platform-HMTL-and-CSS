          <p>
            üåÄ HYPOGEO
          </p>

          <p>
            HypoGeo is "Anything that originates, grows and evolves beneath the
            earth".
          </p>

          <p>
            The description perfectly fits the music: deep, obscure, hypnotic,
            mental, filthy and psychedelic.
          </p>

          <p>
            It takes shades through the producer's musical background:
            orchestrated by extreme metal, industrial & EBM, New Wave, Noise,
            techno, IDM & dark ambient.
          </p>

          <p>
            May 2012 marked the inception of HypoGeo's introduction to the wider
            world of music. The frst full-length album "Tree of Lies" was
            released on Zenon records - the infamous Australian psychedelic
            label.
          </p>

          <p>
            The album was a huge success for the particularly aggressive and
            heavy sound, building the bridge between the deepest of psychedelic
            trance textures, some call it "forest" and the ultimate ‚ÄúZenonesque‚Äù
            sound.
          </p>

          <p>
            No matter what the title, the awe of experiencing a live
            Hypo-performance is second to none, anywhere around the globe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, HypoGeo is working on the long awaited 2nd studio album;
            an epitome of creativity, abstract sonic landscapes, and undeniably
            intricate composition.
          </p>

          <p>
            üåÄ ANS√âO
          </p>

          <p>
            Encrypted Minds previously known as Psynon has been involved in the
            Irish Psytrance Scene for several years now as a DJ And Promoter.
          </p>

          <p>
            He first got infected with the Psybug while attending a festival
            called The Elysian Circus where he found himself stomping away to a
            foreign noise until sunrise. It wasn't long until he made the
            transformation from house and techno to psytrance. This
            transformation was about the same time as The Elysian Circus became
            what is now known as Lunasa Festival.
          </p>

          <p>
            He played a set on their Psytrance stage (THE GEOHEAD) that year and
            to this day is still one of his favourite moments as a DJ. When the
            people responded to the infectious sound he was playing he knew
            there and then he was going to dive headfirst down the rabbit hole
            of psytrance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Encrypted Minds has successfully been running GNOMADS since 2015,
            the west of Ireland's beacon for psytrance. GNOMADS started out of
            love and necessity for more of the sound he craved. With one goal in
            mind ' to leave a lasting impression on everyone that attend the
            events.
          </p>

          <p>
            GNOMADS has been bringing some of the most exciting local, national
            and international DJs throwing them into a pot with the highest
            quality DJ tools then mixing them with the best people in the
            electronic music scene to create phenomenal memories.
          </p>

          <p>
            üåÄ MEERKAT
          </p>

          <p>
            Meerkat is the solo project of Mark Ahessy, who was born and raised
            in Southern Ireland. Mark began his contribution to the Irish
            Psychedelic scene through promoting events across the country. It
            wasn‚Äôt long before his passion for the music evolved into a more
            hands on approach and the Meerkat initiative was born. Initially a
            DJ project, the production bug soon bit and Mark started producing
            his own brand of psychedelia. Meerkat has released a number of well
            received EP‚Äôs and is constantly striving to push the boundaries with
            his sonic palette.
          </p>

          <p>
            üåÄ NOISY BEW
          </p>

          <p>
            Noisy Bew is djane and promoter. Her dedication to deep, dark,
            progressive and psychedelic music brought her on the founder place
            of Psylicious - project which main concern is to promote
            progressive/tech/minimal sounds from the dark side of the moon of
            psychedelic music, blended with visual art.
          </p>

          <p>
            Croatia is her home where she played on festivals and parties,
            promoting her urge and dedication to progressive sounds. Right now,
            Dublin is new step for Noisy Bew and Psylicious where she continues
            to be involved in developing psytrance scene.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, Noisy Bew promotes Mo:Dem festival as an ambassador in
            Ireland.
