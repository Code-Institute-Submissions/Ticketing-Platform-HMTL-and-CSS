User Stories

As an event organiser, I want to post my free event so that I can allocate tickets on the website.

As a somebody interested in attending free events, I want to browse events so that I can buy tickets to events I like




Strategy

Build a website that allows event organisers to post free events and allows people to get free tickets to attend these events.

Scope 

Current Version:

Event organisers can post their events. 

Event organisers can offer three ticket types (morning, afternoon, evening etc.) for each event.

Event organisers can decide whether to allow refunds

Customers can purchase tickets online.


Future Version:

Integration with Stripe to take credit card payments.

Event organisers can charge for tickets.

User accounts can be created.

Customer credit card details can be saved for future use.

Event organisers can sell as many or as few ticket types (early bird, general admission, back-stage access etc.) as they want.

Event organisers can decide when each ticket type will start and stop selling. They can choose to allow tickets to start selling at a specific date or time or when another specific ticket type is sold out.

When an event is sold out, customers can choose to store their credit card details to be charged if another customer requests a refund.

Event organisers can decide to only allow refunds if another customer has saved their credit card details and is waiting to buy the ticket.

Event organisers can re-sell refunded tickets for a higher price.


Structure

The homepage lists all upcoming events. Potential customers can click into each of these events.

The Nav bar contains a link to a page to create an event and also back to the home page.
